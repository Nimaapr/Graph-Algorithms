## Getting Started

Each subdirectory in this repository is structured as an individual project, complete with its own `README.md` for detailed instructions and explanations. You can navigate to each subdirectory to find specific algorithms and their implementations.

### Prerequisites

The projects in this repository primarily use Python and require certain libraries, most notably `networkx` and `matplotlib`. You can install these dependencies via pip:

```sh
pip install networkx matplotlib
```
